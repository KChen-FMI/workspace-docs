# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
- This repository contains the FMI KnowledgeDB specs and MVP plan.
- When making changes, keep the documents concise, structured, and in Japanese unless the file already uses English.

## Workflow
- Prefer editing the currently active spec files:
  - 0.FMI-KnowledgeDB_Spec_for_Codex.md
  - 1.FMI-KBDB-MVP-spec.md
- Preserve existing section headers and numbering.
- Add new content as incremental sections rather than rewriting large blocks.

## Formatting
- Use Markdown headings and bullet lists.
- Keep lines reasonably short and avoid large pasted blocks.
- Mermaid diagrams should be updated only when the architecture meaning changes.

## Infra prep updates
- When updating infra steps, include concrete Azure resources, owners, and checklist-style tasks.
- Clarify dates in absolute form (e.g., 2026-01-30) if using relative terms.
