# FMI IT Documentation Management Plan

## Goal
Create a workflow and structure for FMI IT documentation management, aligned to the B plan catalog DB approach, and define a practical automation roadmap for BAU tasks (daily operations such as account and access setting).

---

## Scope
- Documentation system design and operating workflow (Service Catalog 중심)
- SharePoint-based metadata and document management
- L1/L2/L3 responsibility alignment

Out of scope for this phase:
- Full ITSM tool migration
- Non-IT department documentation governance

---

## Guiding References
- `run-book/fmi_bプラン｜it業務カタログdb_構築アクションプラン.md`

---

## Target Operating Model (Summary)
- **Service = unit of value** and master key for documentation
- **Request = per-case intake**
- **Task/Activity = execution unit**
- **Workflow = ordered steps and approvals**
- **Regulation/Policy = rule foundation**
- **KB = operational knowledge**

---

## Plan A: Documentation System Workflow & Structure

### 1. Structure (Information Architecture)
- **Data Sources (0..many per Service)**
  - 社内規程
  - 定例ワークフロー
  - JIRAチケット
  - インシデント（JIRA）
  - 単発プロジェクト
- **Service Catalog (SharePoint List)**
  - Service ID (primary key)
  - Service name, summary, category
  - Target systems, departments
  - RACI owner (L1/L2/L3)
  - Related Regulation IDs
  - Evidence types
  - Standard SLA
  - Intake URL

- **Document Library (SharePoint)**
  - Document type: Policy / Regulation / Procedure / Evidence / KB
  - Regulation ID
  - Service ID (multi-link)
  - Owner
  - Revision date / expiration

- **Request List (SharePoint List)**
  - Service ID
  - Request type (normal/urgent/exception)
  - Requester / department
  - Due date
  - Approver

- **Task Tracking (Planner, optional)**
  - Standard tasks auto-generated by Power Automate

### 2. Workflow (End-to-End)
1. User submits request via Forms / SPO form
2. Power Automate registers Request List entry
3. Service ID drives standard task creation
4. Tasks assigned to L1/L2/L3 based on rules
5. Evidence documents stored with metadata
6. Service/Regulation/KB linked for audit
7. KPI extracted for capacity and quality

### 3. Governance & Responsibility
- L1: Intake, standard task completion, KB update
- L2: Onsite/physical operations, asset updates
- L3: Service definition, exception design, improvements

### 4. Deliverables
- Service Catalog List (20–40 initial services)
- Document Library with metadata
- Request List with standardized intake
- L1/L2/L3 RACI definition
- Workflow diagram and data model

## Plan B: BAU Automation Roadmap (Daily Ops)

### Target BAU Tasks (Examples)
- Account creation and access assignment
- Joiner/Mover/Leaver processing
- License provisioning and recovery
- Device provisioning and return
- Shared mailbox / group management
- Temporary access management
- Password reset / MFA reset

### Automation Levels
- **Level 0**: Manual, tracked by Request List
- **Level 1**: Standard task templates auto-created
- **Level 2**: Partial automation via Power Automate
- **Level 3**: Full automation with approvals and logging

### Automation Plan by Phase

#### Phase A (2–3 weeks): Standardize and Template
- Define standard tasks per service
- Build task templates and assignment rules
- Ensure evidence capture requirements

#### Phase B (3–4 weeks): Power Automate Integration
- Auto-create tasks from approved requests
- Auto-assign L1/L2/L3 based on rules
- Auto-notify stakeholders (Teams/Email)

#### Phase C (4–6 weeks): Controlled Full Automation
- Automate high-frequency tasks with approvals
  - Example: New account + M365 group membership
  - Example: Standard license allocation
- Add exception handling workflow for L3
- Build audit trail and evidence storage

### Automation Success Criteria
- 60–70% of BAU requests completed by L1/L2
- Reduced L3 exception load
- Evidence and approvals stored automatically
- KPI visibility for daily operations

---

## Timeline (Initial 8–10 Weeks)
1. Weeks 1–2: Define service IDs and RACI
2. Weeks 3–4: Build Service Catalog + Document Library
3. Weeks 5–6: Build Request intake + Task templates
4. Weeks 7–10: Implement Power Automate for BAU tasks

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Service ID definition delay
  - **Mitigation**: Start with 20 core services and expand
- **Risk**: L3 bottleneck persists
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce standard tasks and KB updates
- **Risk**: Evidence gaps for audit
  - **Mitigation**: Mandatory metadata and document linking

---

## Next Actions (2 Weeks)
1. Confirm service ID naming rules
2. Select top 20 services and owners
3. Create SharePoint lists and libraries
4. Draft task templates for top BAU services
5. Identify top 5 BAU tasks for automation pilot
